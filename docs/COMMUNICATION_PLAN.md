# Communication Plan: Results Stakeholder Map

Strategies for delivering technical Bayesian findings to diverse audiences.

## 1. Energy Companies (Operational Impact)
*   **Focus**: Volatility regimes and supply chain risk.
*   **Key Metric**: Estimated standard deviation ($\sigma$) shift and persistence of new price levels.
*   **Channel**: Technical brief with sensitivity analysis on production cost margins.

## 2. Investors (Risk & Opportunity)
*   **Focus**: Probability of trend reversal and returns quantification.
*   **Key Metric**: $P(\mu_2 > \mu_1)$ (Return shift confidence) and 95% HDI of the change point date.
*   **Channel**: Interactive dashboard with "Event Replay" features to simulate historical portfolio exposure.

## 3. Policymakers (Geopolitical Stability)
*   **Focus**: Efficacy of sanctions, impact of conflicts, and energy security.
*   **Key Metric**: Lag time between an event (e.g., Sanctions) and the detected structural market shift.
*   **Channel**: High-level policy memo emphasizing the correlation/causality caveat to avoid reactionary regulation.

## 4. Academic/Scientific Community
*   **Focus**: Model robustness and methodology.
*   **Key Metric**: MCMC convergence diagnostics (R-hat), prior sensitivity, and posterior predictive checks.
*   **Channel**: Peer-reviewed publication or technical whitepaper including the full PyMC model specification.
